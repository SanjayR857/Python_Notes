    "### Sets in Python\n",
    "In Python, a set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Unlike lists or tuples, sets do not allow duplicate values i.e. each element in a set must be unique. Sets are mutable, meaning you can add or remove items after a set has been created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets are defined using curly braces {} or the built-in set() function. They are particularly useful for membership testing, removing duplicates from a sequence, and performing common mathematical set operations like union, intersection, and difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "A set refers to a collection of distinct objects. It is used to group objects together and to study their properties and relationships. The objects in a set are called elements or members of the set."
